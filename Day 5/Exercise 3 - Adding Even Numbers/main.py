# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

# i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

# Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

# Hint
# There are quite a few ways of solving this problem, but you will need to use the range() function in any of the solutions.
# Test Your Code

#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
total = 0

for even_number in range(1, 101):
    if (even_number % 2 == 0):
        total += even_number
print(total)

total2 = 0
for even_number in range(2, 101, 2):
    total2 += even_number
print(total2)
